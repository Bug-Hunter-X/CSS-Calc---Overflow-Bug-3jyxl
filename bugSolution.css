To fix this, use the `box-sizing` property:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  padding: 10px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

By setting `box-sizing: border-box;`, the padding is included within the element's total width, preventing overflow.  This ensures that the calculated width correctly accounts for padding.

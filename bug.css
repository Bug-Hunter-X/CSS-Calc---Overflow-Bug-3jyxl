The following CSS rule leads to unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `calc()` function calculates the width correctly, but the padding might cause the element to overflow its container, especially if the containing element's width is less than the calculated width of the `div`.  This issue is subtle and might be more obvious in dynamically sized layouts.
